        <button class="accordion">Brief History</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>Enniskillen Running Club was founded in 2010, by a group of runners from the town and surrounding areas who wanted to meet up reguarly to run. Flashforward to today, and the club has over 100 members of all ages, abilities amd walks of life. We also hold our own race - "Enniskillen Spooktacular 5K" - every year on the last Friday before Halloween. We also in the last 5 years have ran a Couch To 5K programme biannually.</p>

        <button class="accordion">Training Sessions</button>
            <div class="panel">
                <p>With ERC having members of all ages we hold training sessions nearly every day of the week. All sessions start off and finish at the Lakeland Forum. If you are in the seniors or masters (19+) section, we have sessions at 18:30 to 19:30 on a Monday and Thursday. On Mondays, we do speedwork workouts, and on Thursdays, we do interval training. Some members also meet at 09:00 on a Sunday morning, for a long slower paced run. As for juniors, it is split into two categories - primary school level, and secondary school level. For primary school kids, we organise a training session every Tuesday evening from 17:30-18:30. As for kids in secondary school, they meet every Thursday evening from 18:15 to 19:15. We would encourage if you are in secondary school that you also join your respective schools' cross country team. Please note as well we charge £1 for every training session.</p>
